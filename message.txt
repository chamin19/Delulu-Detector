Aysha: 
Jason, I’ve been feeling a little unsure about where we stand lately. I don’t know, you’ve been a bit distant, and I just want to make sure everything’s okay between us. I’ve been feeling kind of... neglected.

Jason:
Oh, I don’t know. If you think that’s how it is… sighs maybe I’ve just been busy.

Aysha:
But I try to be there for you, and when you pull away, it’s like... I just get worried, you know? I always want to make sure you're happy, but lately, I don’t feel like I'm getting that same energy back.

Jason:
Well, I mean, if that’s what you want… I don’t know what else to say. Things are fine, I guess.

Aysha:
I’m just feeling like I’m doing something wrong, but I don’t know what it is. I try to give you space, but then when I reach out, you just seem so distant, and it makes me doubt myself.

Jason:
I told you, I’ve been busy. You can’t just expect me to be all over you all the time. I have my own stuff going on, too, you know?

Aysha:
I get that, I really do. But it’s like when you don’t reply for hours, it just makes me feel like maybe I’ve done something wrong, or you don’t want to talk to me.

Jason:
I never said I didn’t want to talk to you. pauses I’m just saying, I’m not always gonna be here when you need me. You need to learn how to be okay without constant validation.

Aysha:
I don’t need constant validation… I just want to feel like I matter. That I’m a priority to you. When you’re distant, it feels like I’m not.

Jason:
Well, rolls eyes you’re making a big deal out of nothing. You really think I’d stick around if I didn’t care at all?

Aysha:
I know you care, Jason, I do. But when you say things like that, it just makes me feel like I’m being too much or too needy. I don’t want to push you away.

Jason:
You say that, but honestly, you are a bit too much sometimes. I can’t always be there to give you exactly what you want, and I’m tired of having to reassure you over and over.

Aysha:
I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be overwhelming. I just really need to know that I’m not a burden to you. I just want to make sure you still want this, with me.

Jason:
shakes head I don’t know. I’m just not sure what you want from me anymore. I’ve been saying what I need, but you keep... sighs it’s like you don’t hear me.

Aysha:
I’m trying, Jason. I really am. I just feel like when I try to explain myself, it’s like it doesn’t matter. I want us to be good, but I don’t know how to fix things if you don’t really talk to me about how you feel.

Jason:
Okay, okay. I’ll try harder, but I’m not promising anything. You can’t expect me to be perfect all the time.

Aysha:
I don’t want perfection, Jason, I just want honesty. It’s hard when you give me mixed signals like this.

Jason:
Maybe you should stop overthinking it. Things aren’t as complicated as you make them out to be.

Aysha:
It’s hard to relax when I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time. I need you to be more clear with me.

Jason:
Look, you’ll be fine. If I’m not replying right away, it’s not because I don’t care. It’s just... You need to deal with that, okay?

Aysha:
I hear you, but it still feels like I’m the one doing all the work here. If it’s really that easy for you, why does it feel like I’m the one trying so hard to make everything okay?

Jason:
sighs, irritated Maybe because you’re constantly nitpicking. It’s not always about you needing everything spelled out. Just let things be.

Aysha:
I’m sorry. I just... I really want to feel like we’re both putting in the effort, not just me. That’s all.

Jason:
Yeah, well, we’ll see. But don’t expect me to always be there when you want. I’ve got my limits too, you know?

Aysha:
I understand. I just... wish you’d show me more. But okay.

Jason:
Yeah, okay.
