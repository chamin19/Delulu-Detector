Child:
Hey Mom, I wanted to talk to you about something. I feel like whenever I bring up how I’m feeling, it kind of gets brushed aside.

Parent:
sighs Oh, I didn’t realize I was such a terrible parent. I try my best, you know.

Child:
That’s not what I’m saying. I just feel like it’s hard to talk to you sometimes because you either change the subject or make me feel bad for bringing things up.

Parent:
Well, excuse me for not being perfect. I guess I just don’t know how to be the kind of parent you want. Maybe I should just stop talking altogether since everything I say is wrong.

Child:
That’s not fair, Mom. I’m trying to have an open conversation, but it always turns into me feeling guilty for even bringing it up.

Parent:
I don’t know what you want from me. I worked so hard for you, sacrificed so much, and now you’re here telling me I didn’t do enough? Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?

Child:
That’s not what I’m saying. I appreciate everything you’ve done, but that doesn’t mean my feelings aren’t valid.

Parent:
You’re so sensitive these days. Back in my day, we didn’t dwell on every little feeling. Maybe if you toughened up a bit, you wouldn’t feel so unheard all the time.

Child:
So now it’s my fault?

Parent:
I never said that. But if you always feel this way, maybe you should ask yourself why that is. I can’t be the reason for all your problems.

Child:
I’m not blaming you for everything. I just want to feel like you actually hear me when I talk.

Parent:
Well, I’m sorry you feel that way. I guess I’m just not good enough for you.

Child:
That’s not what I said at all.

Parent:
sighs I just don’t know what you want from me anymore.
