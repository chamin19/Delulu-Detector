Emma:
Hey Mia, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something. I’ve been feeling a little off lately, and I just wanted to check in.

Mia:
Of course, Em! What’s on your mind?

Emma:
I guess I’ve been feeling a bit left out recently. I know you’ve been super busy, but I noticed we haven’t been hanging out as much, and I just wanted to make sure everything’s okay between us.

Mia:
Oh wow, I’m really glad you told me. Honestly, I’ve been so caught up with work and everything that I didn’t even realize how that might’ve felt on your end. I’m so sorry if I made you feel that way!

Emma:
It’s okay, I figured you were busy! I just didn’t want to assume anything. I really value our friendship, and I didn’t want to let any weird feelings build up.

Mia:
I really appreciate that, Em. I value our friendship too, and I don’t ever want you to feel like I don’t. If I ever get too caught up again, just remind me, okay? I never want you to feel like I’m drifting away.

Emma:
That means a lot. I know we’re both juggling a lot, so I get it. Maybe we can set up a little monthly check-in or something? Just to make sure we’re staying connected.

Mia:
I love that idea! Let’s do it. How about a brunch date every first Saturday of the month? That way, we always have time set aside.

Emma:
That sounds perfect. Thanks for listening, Mia. I feel so much better just talking this out.

Mia:
Always, Em. You can talk to me about anything. I got you.
